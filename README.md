## AHRI R library: help and documentation

The wiki help pages serves as a short introduction to the `ahri`
library. These can be found on the wiki tab of this page. The help files
are organised as follows:

  - Getting\_started, which describes which AHRI datasets to request and
    where to put the downloaded .dta datasets. It also shows how to set
    the path to your datasets and read in the .dta datasets.
    <https://github.com/vando026/ahri_help/wiki/Getting_started>

  - Set\_functions, which describes a range of functions for processing
    the data, subsetting the data, and other data tasks.
    <https://github.com/vando026/ahri_help/wiki/Set_functions>

  - hiv\_files, which describes functions used to make the HIV incidence
    datasets, impute the seroconversion dates, perform multiple
    imputation, and calculate annual HIV incidence.

There are other sources of help:

    for example `setFiles`, type `?setFiles`.

    information and for answers to questions someone before you may have
